### 3.3 Key Algorithms and Formulas

#### 3.3.1 Energy Consumption Calculation
```
kWh = (wattage * hours_used) / 1000
```

#### 3.3.2 Cost Calculation
```
cost = kWh * electricity_rate
```

#### 3.3.3 Efficiency Score Algorithm
```
baseline_score = 100
if (avg_daily_consumption > 30):
    score_deduction = min(40, (avg_daily_consumption - 30) * 2)
    score = baseline_score - score_deduction

if (tracking_consistency > 20 days):
    bonus = 10
else if (tracking_consistency > 10 days):
    bonus = 5
else:
    bonus = 0

final_score = max(0, min(100, score + bonus))
```
